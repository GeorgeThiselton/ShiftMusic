<h1>Project: Shift</h1>
<h2>Open source, non-profit music streaming service.</h2>

<p>ShiftMusic is digital music streaming at its fairest,
Based around the hybrid royalty concept of the marriage between 'user-centric licensing' and 'pro-rata'.</p>

<p>Major music streaming services have been utilizing pro-rata since inception and it simply hasn’t presented itself as a fair model for millions of artists worldwide.</p>

<p>Aiming for an open source development environment gives the project the ability to function as a not-for-profit and direct the majority of revenue towards the artists.</p>

<p>Project Shift is entirely about pushing the music industry to the best it can be.</p>

<h2>Q&A</h2>

<h3>What is ‘user-centric licensing’?</h3>

<p>‘user-centric licensing’ in digital music streaming terms means that your subscription fee is spread out through the artists you actively listen to throughout the month. Each artist makes up a part of your overall listening percentage. The more you’ve listened to an artist, the larger cut they get of your subscription.</p>

<p>Individual plays alone aren’t valued in this system but more so the percentage that the artist makes up of your active listening catalog for the month.</p>

<h3>What is ‘Pro-rata’?</h3>

<p>Pro-rata in digital music streaming terms means that your subscription fee is placed into a giant pool where the royalties are spread out across the artists on the service, based on the total percentage they make up of listeners on the service.</p>

<p>The flaw is that the artists with the highest listening percentage on the service take much higher royalties per play then your favorite niche artist would.</p>

<p>This results in your subscription fee’s being put to the huge top 40 artists that you may not even be listening to, or support at all.</p>

<h3>If both systems are flawed, how will this work?</h3>

<p>ShiftMusic aims to utilize these royalty systems with a simple switch that can be toggled at the end of each billing cycle.
are you a light user and only listen to a handful of artists each month? or are you a heavy user that listens to tons of artists? with this option you will be able to change the way you distribute your subscription fee.</p>

<p>Acting as non-profit allows us to develop our ecosystem entirely open-source and community driven, without being taken advantage of by investors and bottom dollar corporations. Not to mention provide an industry leading royalty to artists worldwide.</p>

<h3>Why are you doing this?</h3>

<p>Simple. I'm a musician.</p>

<p>As a first-hand witness to the incredibly poor royalty payouts the current services provide, I did some research and found that it wasn't just the little guys. It was the vast majority.</p>

<p>Digging further online I came across an article Published on September 3, 2015 titled "<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/backwards-incentives-why-spotify-gives-your-money-artists-laguana/" target="_blank">Backwards Incentives: Why Spotify Gives Your Money To Artists You Don't Listen To</a>" By a man named Sharky Laguana, In this article, Sharky talks about the poor incentives these services provide artists, and a potential better model that could reshape the way royalties work.</p>

<p>"Why hadn't anyone attempted this?" I thought. one startup did a few years ago, but there is little to no resources online on what became of them. So in April 2018 I made the ballsy decision of making such an attempt.</p>

<p>As with any massive, ridiculous idea, I didn't know what I was getting into. Being completely inexperienced and unqualified, I dedicated the next few months to ideas and education (also becoming repeatedly burnt-out). I'd been looking for co-founders the whole way with little to no luck.</p>

<h3>Why Open-source?</h3>

<p>Open-source allows the development environment to be entirely community based, while allowing people to work on large scale projects for their portfolios and further their careers.</p>

<h3>Why non-profit?</h3>

<p>The global music scene is a multi-billion dollar industry... and an incredibly low percentage of that actually goes to artists.</p>

<p>I've never cared that much for money beyond making a living. With the sheer capacity for automation in technology today,
The ability to function as a non-profit in the tech space has never been easier.</p>
